    <p>Emmet is great for that.
        With it installed in the code editor you are using,
        you can type “lorem” and then tab and it will
        expand into a paragraph of Lorem Ipsum placeholder
        text. But it can do more! You can control how
        much you get, place it within HTML structure
        as it expands, and get different bits of it
        in repeated elements.</p>
